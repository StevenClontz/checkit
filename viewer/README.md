# CheckIt Viewer

A single-page Svelte/TypeScript application available at <https://checkit.clontz.org>. This app reads
JSON "banks" generated by <https://github.com/stevenclontz/checkit/> and provides an elegant interface
for students to practice these exercises, and for instructors to generate LaTeX/PDF quizzes using
these exercises.

## Embedding CheckIt content into your site/LMS/blog

To embed the exercises at <https://checkit.clontz.org/#/banks/clontz-diff-eq/DL3> into another webpage,
simply copy-paste the code shown below, noting that `embed/` is inserted before the `#`.
(No loading Javascript or anything fancy...)

```
<iframe id="iframeCheckItOutcome"
    title="Iframe CheckIt Outcome"
    width="800"
    height="450"
    src="https://checkit.clontz.org/embed/#/banks/clontz-diff-eq/DL3">
</iframe>
```

A simplified code cell powered by [SageMathCell](https://sagecell.sagemath.org/) is available at
<https://checkit.clontz.org/codecell/#python>. By changing the hash value to any supported language
(e.g. <https://checkit.clontz.org/codecell/#r>) you can specify the default language selected when loading the
page, but users can always choose their language of choice. This too can be embedded into most
webpages and LMSs by using an iframe:

```
<iframe id="iframeCodeCell"
    title="Iframe Code Cell"
    width="800"
    height="450"
    src="https://checkit.clontz.org/codecell/#sage">
</iframe>
```

# svelte app (original template README)

This is a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-app
cd svelte-app
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*


## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.


## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).


## Single-page app mode

By default, sirv will only respond to requests that match files in `public`. This is to maximise compatibility with static fileservers, allowing you to deploy your app anywhere.

If you're building a single-page app (SPA) with multiple routes, sirv needs to be able to respond to requests for *any* path. You can make it so by editing the `"start"` command in package.json:

```js
"start": "sirv public --single"
```

## Using TypeScript

This template comes with a script to set up a TypeScript development environment, you can run it immediately after cloning the template with:

```bash
node scripts/setupTypeScript.js
```

Or remove the script via:

```bash
rm scripts/setupTypeScript.js
```

## Deploying to the web

### With [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

Install `vercel` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
cd public
vercel deploy --name my-project
```

### With [surge](https://surge.sh/)

Install `surge` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g surge
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
npm run build
surge public my-project.surge.sh
```
